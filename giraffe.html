                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>
                    Giraffes grow about 4 feet (1.2 meters) in their first year of life. A newborn giraffe is
                    about 6 feet (1.9 meters) tall at birth and weighs about 150 pounds (68 kilograms).</p>
                     <p>Many young giraffes, called calves, die from lion attacks during their first year of
                        life. Once a giraffe reaches adulthood its height is often enough to protect it from 
                        lions. Adult giraffes, however, must still be careful of lions when they are bending 
                        down to drink water or rest. Usually giraffes will drink or rest in shifts so that at
                         least one giraffe is always on the lookout for approaching predators.​</p>
                   <p>The giraffes' height and excellent vision give them a wide view of the grasslands where
                     they live, making it easy to spot predators from a distance. Some scientists believe that 
                     other animals—such as zebras, antelope, and wildebeests—often congregate near giraffes to
                      take advantage of their ability to see danger from a distance. The giraffe could be considered
                       the early warning system of the African grasslands.</p>
                   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E23, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
