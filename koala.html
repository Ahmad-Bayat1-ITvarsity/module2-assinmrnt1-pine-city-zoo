                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The koala is about 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 inches) long and weighs up to 14 kg (31 pounds) in the southern part of its range (Victoria and South Australia) but only about half that in subtropical Queensland to the north. Virtually tailless, the body is stout and gray, with a pale yellow or cream-coloured chest and mottling on the rump. The broad face has a wide, rounded, leathery nose, small yellow eyes, and big fluffy ears. The feet are strong and clawed; the two inner digits of the front feet and the innermost digit of the hind feet are opposable for grasping. Because of the animalâ€™s superficial resemblance to a small bear, the koala is sometimes called, albeit erroneously, the koala bear.</p>
                     <p>Studies suggest that there are five distinct populations of koalas, which began to diverge from one another sometime between 300,000 and 430,000 years ago.</p>
                   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E26, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
